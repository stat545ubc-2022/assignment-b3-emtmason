### Assignment B3: Shiny App
This repository is intended to meet the requirements for STAT545B Assignment 3, wherein a Shiny App is coded and published to Shinyapp.io

The following functions are included in this app:

(1) Functional widgit: selecting variables to include on x-axis of graph. This is useful because it allows the user to visualize relationships between different variables and petal width.
(2) Change in UI: Added the luxe bootstrap theme. This is a useful function because it makes the app more aesthetically pleasing.
(3) Functional widgit: checkbox to include outliers. This allows the user to choose whether or not data outliers are displayed on the graphs.
