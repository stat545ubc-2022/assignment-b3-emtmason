### Assignment B3: Shiny App
This repository is intended to meet the requirements for STAT545B Assignment 3, wherein a Shiny App is coded and published to Shinyapp.io

Option Selected: B (create a novel Shiny App)
Link to running app: https://emtmasonjar.shinyapps.io/iris-app/


The following functions are included in this app to fulfill requirements for Assignment B3:

[x]  Functional widgit: selecting variables to include on x-axis of graph. This is useful because it allows the user to visualize relationships between different variables and petal width.
[x]  Change in UI: Added the paper theme, making text and colours of the UI aesthetically pleasing (and complementary to content of the app - purple iris flowers)
[x]  Functional widgit: checkbox to include outliers. This allows the user to choose whether or not data outliers are displayed on the graphs.
